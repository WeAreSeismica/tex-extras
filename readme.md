# Seisimica "extra" tools

This is a collection of tools for TeX and BibTeX gathered for Seismica authors and copyeditors. The starting point is aux2bib, modified from [bibtools](https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtools). More things may be added in the future.

## contents

`aux2bib` -- perl script that reads an aux file and a bib file, and outputs a new bib file containing only the references used in the project. The script needs to be in a directory with the aux and bib file and takes the aux filename as its sole argument.
